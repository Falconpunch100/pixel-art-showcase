        <h1>Falconpunch's Pixel Art Showcase</h1>


        I've drawn a ton of graphics for 16-bit games for years, and I've improved my technique with each stroke of a
        brush.<br>A lot of the stuff I have is old, and I will likely go back and redo them later to see how much I've
        improved.<br>Additionally, a few other sets I may show are not drawn by me, due to them being in a collaboration
        with other graphics artists at the time.
        <br>
        Regardless, I will show you what I have been working on.

        <div id="fire">This was originally a weird-looking tileset that served only one whole purpose in the game.
            However, rather than throwing it away, I decided to improve it instead, and add more life to it as well.<br>
            There are two palette versions I made for two levels: The first one is for Lava Lift Lair, whilst the other
            is for Smoldering Shrine.<br></div>
